These questions seem to be too large to be too large, so that they can use their own stories to define their own good.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/dmj.jpg" style="width: 334px; height: 450px;" /></p><p><strong>Death is not terrible, terrible is to come to the world, but like never came to</strong></p><p>Du Mengjie, the CEO, was born in 1989. When he was four, most of the people around him are not &amp; ldquo; all the chips &amp; rdquo; concept, but he used nearly 20000 words of fundraising letters on the Internet for their raised to travel expenses, the drop out a year to travel dream. He went to India to do AIDS charity projects in Afghanistan to the logistics company CEO to do assistant to participate in international organizations, the way to work in India, Nepal, Dubai, Bahrain and Afghanistan five countries. In Afghanistan, he and death, but also on the initiation of a world of ideas, then decided to return home, decided to start.</p><p>The explosion in Afghanistan, is next to my company, I thought Taliban came hub. I think if you really die here and you won't be any news &amp;mdash; &amp;mdash; it's a terrible thing that you've been living for so long.
				</p><p><strong>I want to help others to achieve creative, talent and dream of </strong></p><p> Du Mengjie after returning home to spend a month to run: &amp;ldquo; and not the beginning to do all the chips. I went to a lot of cities, see some of the older, and friends to chat. Once I have decided, it will be very serious preparation, careful planning what I need, what to do, how to design. Entrepreneurship is the same, the decision to start a business is a very exciting thing for me. But I decided to do it, I will be very rational to design, see what people, what things to prepare. This time I will not rush. &amp;rdquo;</p><p>11 years in May, Du Mengjie went to see a friend to talk about business ideas. Friends say that your experience is not a lot of people to help you, it is better to do a platform to help others to achieve their dreams, creativity, and talent. &amp;ldquo; I was thinking, Bingo, &amp;rdquo; the idea was to get Du Mengjie excited, &amp;ldquo; and that's what we did. &amp;rdquo;</p><p>With good ideas, of course, not necessarily smooth sailing. At the beginning of the venture, Du Mengjie and his team to imitate the largest and most mature of foreign countries to do the platform to do, including music, film, animation, publishing, science and technology, games, and more than a dozen categories covering all the chips. But every project they want to re find resources, user base and promotion channels, the user is very difficult to generate a sense of their site. Later, they try to find a future in the category of the largest development space to do, the results showed that no direction is the team can Hold live, the team did not know what they are doing, the entire team is facing collapse. In the end, they decided to return to the beginning of the heart, from their favorite, their understanding of the beginning, from a good start.</p><p>Du Mengjie's team members are more than 20 year old young people, their educational background and personal experience is also very rich, such a team, in fact, the most familiar is the young people on the 20 years of what you want to do. So, a help young people or 90 through the congregation to raise, to find, experience their favorite way of life website positioning to establish this.</p><p>Dream network should have such a possibility and opportunity, the congregation raised let every man out of 50, 100, 200, together to write a book, go to the inn, to travel together, or other fun things, this is connected to the user to participate in to experience to access to a thing, the is to help young people to discover to participate in their favorite things. &amp;rdquo; the ultimate goal of </p><p><strong> is to die on the road.</strong></p><p><strong>In Du Mengjie's view, the young people in addition to like &amp;ldquo; the novelty of cool &amp;rdquo; things outside, but also the fact that can bring their own growth and change the experience or experience.</strong>Such as TED, such as, a table, such as sharing the form of speech, such as &amp;ldquo; 2015WINTER Hongkong finance &amp;amp; business 500 strong enterprises practice project &amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo; with me to join the SAS Maritime Academy, to 16 countries to learn the movie &amp;rdquo; such as self learning, to grow extra points &amp;ldquo; non selling products &amp;rdquo.<strong>Because young people or 90 this group is in the personal growth stage, they have great curiosity about the world, and their vision and insight to drive them to understand, experience a greater stage and the world, and are willing to allow themselves to grow up and consume.</strong></p><p>In July this year, the network and the AIESEC (International Economics School Student Association) signed an exclusive cooperation agreement to raise public. AIESEC as the world's largest student organization, the independent operation of young students, to provide a platform for young students to develop their own leadership, to provide young college students with international cultural exchanges, overseas internships and other opportunities to hone practical leadership.
