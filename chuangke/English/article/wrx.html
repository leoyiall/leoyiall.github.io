			<div class="zhengwen">
				<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="../../images/wrx.png"  /></p><p>Compared with &amp;ldquo; high handed President &amp;rdquo; Yu Jiawen, &amp;ldquo; only 1% of life &amp;rdquo; Chen Anni and other popular media sought after 90 star entrepreneurs, &amp;ldquo; part time cat &amp; founder Wang Ruixu obviously a lot of low-key. &amp; part time cat &amp;rdquo; also a word can be introduced clearly App: College Students' part-time recruitment platform. However, the graduated last year was born in Guangzhou University of traditional Chinese medicine of 90 years in the Chaozhou Shantou entrepreneurs, but on Tuesday has been meeting with Premier Li Keqiang.</p><p>Here is a report from the Communist Party of China:</p><p>January 27th morning, Premier Li Keqiang held a forum in Zhongnanhai, to listen to education, science and technology, culture, health, sports and grassroots people on behalf of the government work report (Draft) comments and suggestions. At the meeting, the 10 representatives of the economic and social development in the past year and the new year outlook, around the government work report on the contents of the views, put forward suggestions. At the meeting, the basketball player Yao Ming proposed reform of sports management system, for the development of sports industry &amp;ldquo; relaxed &amp;. Film and television actor Chen Daoming proposed to launch more international influence of film and television works. Guangzhou nine Information Technology Co., Ltd. Wang Ruixu, combined with their own experience of college students to carry out a proposal. Li Keqiang and their in-depth exchanges, he said, and promote public entrepreneurship, innovation and peoples, college students are an important force in the, for them to realize their dreams and their own value &amp; ldquo; pave the way &amp; rdquo; to create the conditions. &amp;</p><p>Wang Ruixu's company &amp;ldquo; nine tail technology &amp;rdquo; second days in the micro channel public number issued a document saying, &amp;ldquo; in the news broadcast 5 minutes after we received a phone call from a media, want to interview us. In the next 20 minutes, we has continued to receive nearly ten media, the newspaper about telephone visit. Most of them will be asked such a question: &amp;ldquo; your part time cat Wang Ruixu with what as a 90 after the business representatives to go to Beijing! Why would he go? &amp;</p><p>Then, this young team gives the answer unashamedly and be in high and vigorous spirits</p><blockquote> <p>Ha ha, after 90 of many entrepreneurs, Wang Ruixu is not the most famous one. May be a lot of people will think of Yu Jiawen, Chen Anni, et al., relative to them, what you Wang Ruixu!</p> <p>But we want to say, with a low-key can do? Did not grab a circle of friends, there is no high-profile show financing, but no other lace news. Do more to say, this is more in line with the requirements of this era? Than arrogance, arrogant, immature, these to the label after 90, I believe we would prefer to see 90 courageously, tough, dependable, fighting side, and Wang Ruixu just do the sets an example, insist to do the hardest struggle after 90 young entrepreneurs.</p>  <p>Society needs a new atmosphere, 90 of the image need new definition. We want to restoration, to make the new 90 images can transfer positive energy of youth.</p></blockquote><p>After the media reported widely known is that &amp; ldquo; fast read comics &amp; rdquo; founder chenanni and &amp; ldquo; gift to say &amp; rdquo; founder Wencheng glance at college together and established a studio selling postcards, thus earning entrepreneurship Diyitongjin. In fact, at that time, Wang Ruixu also through campus advertising, earned his first pot of gold. There are too many common labels on them: are 90, is in Guangzhou University, all Chaoshanese</p><p>Wang Ruixu is a typical Chaoshan entrepreneurs, the University for four years, he was no less frustrating. In his own words, &amp; we all do what we can to make money on the campus &amp;. At the beginning, the team has only two people; the peak time, the team has more than 80 people. Up to now, &amp;ldquo; part time cat &amp;rdquo; more than 40 people in the team, there are more than a dozen people in college when you follow Wang Rui Xu toss together.</p><p>Why do so many people are willing to follow you all the business? Hear this question, Wang Ruixu wanted to say: &amp;ldquo; I think it is not for the money, as the team's Leader, you want to let you believe that you will have meat to eat.</p><p>Just when college, Wang Ruixu half a month to spend a month's living expenses. Then, he called and asked for money, and felt the disappointment of his parents. He thought that he could not ask for money again. So in the next time wangrui Xu to make money do many attempts: do a part-time job, as a security guard, set up a stall, even a model agent. After the trial, he can not only himself to support himself, and even to support the team, which makes him gradually realized, perhaps, college students can do this thing.</p><p>This is &amp;ldquo; part-time cat &amp;rdquo origin.</p><p>However, despite the fact that a toss, Wang Ruixu did not abandon their studies. On the contrary, he took a lot of scholarship in the University, which is called learning tyrants. And the other people in the team are also taking into account the learning and entrepreneurship. Wang Ruixu smiled and said: &amp;ldquo; many people may harbor Tucao us.</p><p>In October 2013, &amp;ldquo; part time cat &amp;rdquo; the first version on line; in April 2014, &amp;ldquo; part time cat &amp;rdquo; to get the innovation valley of 1000000 yuan angel investment, completed Pre-A round of financing in September. Wang Ruixu said, &amp;ldquo; part-time cat &amp;rdquo; the current valuation has billions of dollars.</p><p>&ldquo;Part time cat &amp;rdquo; the official introduction is written in this way: part time cat is a data mining based personalized information recommendation engine &amp; &amp; has this will sell Meng kitten, you can master more than one part of the site information. Her part time information has been multi verification, the information is the highest in the industry. We hope that the future will be able to buy an insurance for every student who uses a part-time cat. </p><p> now, &amp;ldquo; part time cat &amp;rdquo; has covered more than 40 cities nationwide, with about 1000000 students and more than 3 business users. Wang Ruixu said, &amp;ldquo; part time cat &amp;rdquo; the number of Posts received every day is close to 10000, the success rate of 80%. &amp;ldquo; part time cat &amp;rdquo; 2015's goal is to cover more cities, and will set up a team in various cities. Now, &amp;ldquo; part time cat &amp;rdquo; in Changsha and Wuhan have their own team, the office of Beijing has been a prototype.</p><p>Close to graduation, Wang Ruixu with &amp;ldquo; part time cat &amp;rdquo; participated in a college student entrepreneurship competition, and parents happen to see the game on TV, they were surprised to ask: how do you go? Why don't you go to the civil service exam? Wangrui Xu answered truthfully say: I have now set up a company that get invested, what's done is done, must continue to do.</p><p>Li Jiacheng Wang Ruixu is a native of Chaozhou most admired by the people. He said, no matter what to do, I hope you can do that One Number, or else it would not have fun.</p>
